# TCPDelayMod

I'm a big fan of 1.7.10 and I think we should all go back to 1.7.10.

Unfortunately, for some reason everyone wants to stay on 1.8.9. :angry:

So I thought, "Hey, what if I bring 1.7.10 to 1.8.9!"

Introducing, TCPDelayMod.

TCPDelay purposefully adds delay by undoing the fix that was added in 1.8.1 and by prplz in his ever so famous 1.7 mod. Just as god intended.
